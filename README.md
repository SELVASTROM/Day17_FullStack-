## Day 17 - Full Stack Developer Accelerated Plan
Overview
On Day 17, the focus was on mastering interfaces, multithreading in Java, MySQL views and indexes, and JavaScript timers through the following key areas:

## Java - Interfaces and Multithreading
- Learned how to define and implement Java interfaces.
- Practiced creating classes implementing multiple interfaces.
- Explored multithreading concepts using the `Runnable` interface and thread lifecycle.
- Implemented thread creation, starting, and thread sleep methods.

## MySQL - Views and Indexes
- Learned how to create and use Views to simplify complex queries and provide data abstraction.
- Practiced creating Indexes to improve query performance and optimize data retrieval.
- Continued practicing constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL.

## JavaScript - Timers and Animation Control
- Implemented JavaScript timers with setTimeout and setInterval.
- Learned how to control animations and UI updates based on timer events.

## Skills Developed
- Strong understanding of interface-based design and abstraction in Java.
- Practical experience in concurrent programming with threads.
- Knowledge of database optimization techniques using views and indexes in MySQL.
- UI interaction enhancements using JavaScript timers.

## Next Steps
- Deepen knowledge of Java concurrency with thread synchronization and thread pools.
- Explore advanced MySQL features including stored procedures and triggers.
- Build interactive UI components integrating JavaScript timers and event handling.
- Start working on full-stack mini projects combining Java backend and frontend interactivity.
